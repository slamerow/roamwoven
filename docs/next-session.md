# Next Session Notes

## Current State

Roamwoven has a static beta flow plus the first backend-ready trip lifecycle:

`/maker` -> `/maker/trips/demo-trip` -> upload -> review -> clean data -> style -> publish -> `/t/demo`

The app uses the Asia workbook as seed data:

- 25 trip legs.
- 313 activity/cards.
- Real seed file: `data/asia-trip-seed.json`.
- Importer: `scripts/import-asia-workbook.py`.

Interactive local-only UI exists for:

- Upload intake.
- Review questions.
- Style settings.
- Publish actions.

Backend-ready pieces now exist:

- `db/schema.sql` includes V1 trip fields for payment status, theme pack, password flags, photo metrics, and sensitive-field visibility.
- `lib/trips.ts` lists, loads, and creates trips through Supabase when env vars are configured.
- Without Supabase env vars, the maker flow falls back to the Wren's Adventure demo trip.
- Real trip upload is gated behind payment status.
- Stripe Checkout scaffolding exists with promotion-code support and env placeholders.
- The Stripe webhook route can mark trips paid after `checkout.session.completed`.

## Important Product Decisions

- Beta should use real Stripe Checkout with promo codes/discounts for test users.
- Public launch and beta should charge or explicitly discount before expensive AI extraction.
- Maker app is the user-facing source of truth.
- Database will be the technical source of truth.
- Traveler app should be one hosted template backed by trip snapshots.
- Photos are part of V1, with count/size/retention limits and no video.
- Wren's Adventure remains the user's real trip app and the reference UX for legs, categories, calendar/day views, search, phrases, maps, and mobile cards.
- Vercel deployment is deferred because Wren's Adventure may already use the available deployment slot.

## Recommended Next Task

Finish payment setup and then move into authenticated persistence:

1. Create Stripe account/product/price when the business setup is ready.
2. Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_TRIP_PRICE_ID`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. Exercise test-mode Checkout with promotion codes.
4. Configure Supabase env variables and apply `db/schema.sql`.
5. Add auth/session enforcement around maker routes.

Keep upload/extraction mocked until trip persistence is working.

Promo-code beta should exercise the same paid-trip lifecycle as normal checkout. Keep expensive extraction mocked until payment and owner-scoped trip persistence are both working.

Small scaffold already exists:

- `lib/env.ts`
- `lib/supabase/client.ts`
- `lib/supabase/server.ts`
- `db/schema.sql`
- `db/README.md`
- `lib/billing/stripe.ts`
- `app/maker/trips/[tripId]/checkout/route.ts`
- `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
